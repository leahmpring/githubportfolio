## Introduction

![Introduction](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/b0af15_5f63f193e0d94b49915d84f74e7aa228~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_980,h_1098,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/b0af15_5f63f193e0d94b49915d84f74e7aa228~mv2.jpg)

Passionate about merging the art of marketing with the science of data, I'm dedicated to crafting narratives that resonate with companies, clients, and shape the future. My vision is to build brands that not only thrive but also care deeply about their impact on customers, communities, and the environment.

With a firm belief in the transformative power of businesses, I strive to foster meaningful connections between companies and their clientele. By integrating sustainability into brand DNA, we can create lifestyle brands that stand the test of time and contribute positively to our world.

Currently on the verge of completing my Bachelor of Science in Marketing, I'm eager to collaborate with companies that share these values and are committed to a future where business is a force for good. Let's work together in forging a path toward a more sustainable and prosperous tomorrow.

#### Daniels Distinction Thesis

To pursue a Distinction in Marketing from the University of Denver, I researched and developed a thesis on "What Kazakhstan can learn from South Korea's K-pop to increase tourism and economic growth." The paper first unravels the mechanics behind the idol industry in South Korea to understand what differentiates K-pop from the rest of the music industry. Next, it discusses the power of K-pop fandoms and the reason behind their massive social media impact. Lastly, it touches on the importance of politics in promoting a positive environment for tourism.

## Music Projects 

One of my greatest passions is music. During my study abroad at Lund University in Sweden, I developed an idea for an application called NEXUS. 

NEXUS is a mobile application and website designed to help you meet your next favorite artist in a way like never before. Crafted as an immersive experience, this application increases cultural awareness and ethnic identity, strengthens relationships between artists and fans, and allows artists to offer original content to their fans.

Inspired by Spotify World Map 2.0
